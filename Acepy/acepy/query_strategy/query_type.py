        AllLabels: Query all _labels of an instance
        PartLabels: Query part of labels of an instance (Only available in multi-label setting)
        Features: Query unlab_features of instances
    NotImplementedQueryType
        Relations: Query relations between two object
        Examples: Query examples given constrains


    AllLabels: query all labels of an selected instance.
        Support scene: binary classification, multi-class classification, multi-label classification, regression

    Partlabels: query part of labels of an instance.
        Support scene: multi-label classification

    Features: query part of features of an instance.
        Support scene: missing features
